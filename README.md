# hugo-purus: A pure theme for Hugo

*purus*&nbsp;(the Latin word for 'pure') is the theme powering [my personal website](https://bastian.rieck.me).
It offers you *the* no-frills experience for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) that you might be craving for.

## Summary

The theme is mean to support a simple&nbsp;(personal | academic) website with an additional blog section. It
assumes that the content is laid out in the following form in your `content` folder:

- `_index.md`: the main index file
- `foo.md`: a section called `foo`
- `bar.md`: a section called `bar`
- `blog/`: a folder containing your blog posts
